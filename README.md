# Playbooks
Playbooks designed for IBM SOAR developed by The IR Gurus. These playbooks can be used to demonstrate how to design playbooks, perform automations, and expand your SOP library within your environment.

All Playbooks built within this GitHub should be importable on IBM SOAR v46 or higher unless explicitly stated.

Lastly is how to import these Playbooks:

>Method 1: All of the playbooks in a .resz format are playbook exports and can be imported through the Playbooks Environment using the button "Import playbook" just to the left of blue "Create playbook" button. For additional details about this, follow the instruction in the KB article.

>Method 2: All of the playbooks in a .res format are organization exports which contain all of the playbooks in the folder. The exports don't contain the integration itself, so before importing these into your environment, you will need to install any needed integrations which will be in the README's of the folder you find the files. These files can be imported in using Organization Migrate Settings located in the Administrator Settings -> Organizations -> Migrate Settings -> Import. Use the blue "Import Settings +" button on the right. For additional details about this, follow the instruction in the KB article.
