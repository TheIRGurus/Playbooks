# Playbooks
Playbooks designed for IBM SOAR developed by The IR Gurus. These playbooks can be used to demonstrate how to design playbooks, perform automations, and expand your SOP library within your environment.

All Playbooks built within this GitHub should be importable on IBM SOAR v45 or higher unless explicitly stated.

Lastly is how to import these Playbooks. All of these playbooks can be imported through the Playbooks Environment using the button "Import playbook" just to the left of blue "Create playbook" button. For additional details about this, follow the instruction in the KB article.
