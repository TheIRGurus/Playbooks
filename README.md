# Playbooks
Playbooks designed for IBM SOAR developed by The IR Gurus. These playbooks can be used to demonstrate how to design playbooks, perform automations, and expand your SOP library within your environment.

All Playbooks built within this GitHub should be importable on IBM SOAR v45 or higher unless explicitly stated.
