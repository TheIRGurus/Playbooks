# Simple Automation Playbooks
These playbooks are fairly simple in design, but offer quick automations within the platform. Each playbook is explained below.


## Assign to Me
This is a playbook designed to easily allow an analyst to assign the incident to themselves instead of having to edit the incident after finding where the Owner Field is located.

## Update Determined Date
This is a playbook designed to Update the Date Determined whenever the Incident Disposition (field determining if a true incident or not) is marked confirmed (True).
